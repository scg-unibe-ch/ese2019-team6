2420 - Introduction to Software Engineering Report			                                        	11.26.19

Purpose: Creating a responsive advertising website for different services offered to customers in related areas.

Description: The website should be able to successfully sign up users, login users, post users’ advertises 
and keep track of users. The application is an event management form which is a hybrid application 
made with Ionic 4 and Angular in Webstorm. Each user can sign up as a customer or service provider at the beginning. 
Then the users need to login in order to find a related service provider and to connect with them 
and to offer a service to users.

We used https://eventify.io as an example platform.
Our roadmap can be found here: https://trello.com
